            MY FRIST DAY AT SCHOOL
        </h1>
        <h4>
          <span>My first day at scool</span>   was very interesting. I woke up early in the morning. My mother prepared my tiffin. I put on my uniform and had my breakfast. I went to the new school on foot with my father. After reaching there, I was very excited. My father introduced me with the hedmaster. He took me into my classroom and introduced me with my teacher and classmates. I talked with them. They were very friend and helpful. One of them made me his friend. In the tiffin time I shared my tiffin with my friend. A new school is a new experience and I really enjoy the day.It was an interesting.
